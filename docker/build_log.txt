	class DoubleQLearning(Boost.Python.instance)
	|  This class represents the double QLearning algorithm.
	|
	|  The QLearning algorithm is biased to overestimate the expected future
	|  reward during the Bellman equation update, as the bootstrapped max over
	|  the same QFunction is actually an unbiased estimator for the expected
	|  max, rather than the max expected.
	|
	|  This is a problem for certain classes of problems, and DoubleQLearning
	|  tries to fix that.
	|
	|  DoubleQLearning maintains two separate QFunctions, and in a given
	|  timestep one is selected randomly to be updated. The update has the same
	|  form as the standard QLearning update, except that the *other* QFunction
	|  is used to estimate the expected future reward. The math shows that this
	|  technique still results in a bias estimation, but in this case we tend
	|  to underestimate.
	|
	|  We can still try to counteract this with optimistic initialization, and
	|  the final result is often more stable than simple QLearning.
	|
	|  Since action selection should be performed w.r.t. both QFunctions,
	|  DoubleQLearning stores two things: the first QFunction, and the sum
	|  between the first QFunction and the second. The second QFunction is not
	|  stored explicitly, and is instead always computed on-the-fly when
	|  needed.
	|
	|  We do this so we can easily return the sum of both QFunction to apply a
	|  Policy to, without the need to store three separate QFunctions
	|  explicitly (lowering a bit the memory requirements).
	|
	|  If you are interested in the actual values stored in the two 'main'
	|  QFunctions, please use getQFunctionA() and getQFunctionB(). Note that
	|  getQFunctionB() will not return a reference!

	|      getDiscount( (DoubleQLearning)self) -> float :
	|          This function returns the currently set discount parameter.
	|
	|  getLearningRate(...)
	|      getLearningRate( (DoubleQLearning)self) -> float :
	|          This function will return the current set learning rate parameter.
	|
	|  getQFunction(...)
	|      getQFunction( (DoubleQLearning)self) -> Matrix2D :
	|          This function returns a reference to the internal 'sum' QFunction.
	|
	|          The QFunction that is returned does not contain 'true' values,
	|          but instead is the sum of the two QFunctions that are being
	|          updated by DoubleQLearning. This is to make it possible to
	|          select actions using standard policy classes.
	|
	|          The returned reference can be used to build Policies, for example
	|          MDP::QGreedyPolicy.
	|
	|          @return The internal 'sum' QFunction.
	|
	|  getQFunctionA(...)
	|      getQFunctionA( (DoubleQLearning)self) -> Matrix2D :
	|          This function returns a reference to the first internal QFunction.
	|
	|          The returned reference can be used to build Policies, for
	|          example MDP::QGreedyPolicy, but you should probably use
	|          getQFunction() for that.
	|
	|          @return The internal first QFunction.
	|
	|  getQFunctionB(...)
	|      getQFunctionB( (DoubleQLearning)self) -> Matrix2D :
	|          This function returns a copy to the second QFunction.
	|
	|          This QFunction is constructed on the fly, and so is not returned by reference!
	|
	|          @return What the second QFunction should be.
	|
	|  getS(...)
	|      getS( (DoubleQLearning)self) -> int :

	|
	|  setDiscount(...)
	|      setDiscount( (DoubleQLearning)self, (float)d) -> None :
	|          This function sets the new discount parameter.
	|
	|          The discount parameter controls the amount that future rewards are considered
	|          by DoubleQLearning. If 1, then any reward is the same, if obtained now or in a million
	|          timesteps. Thus the algorithm will optimize overall reward accretion. When less
	|          than 1, rewards obtained in the presents are valued more than future rewards.
	|
	|          @param d The new discount factor.
	|
	|  setLearningRate(...)
	|      setLearningRate( (DoubleQLearning)self, (float)a) -> None :
	|          This function sets the learning rate parameter.
	|
	|          The learning parameter determines the speed at which the
	|          QFunction is modified with respect to new data. In fully
	|          deterministic environments (such as an agent moving through
	|          a grid, for example), this parameter can be safely set to
	|          1.0 for maximum learning.
	|
	|          On the other side, in stochastic environments, in order to
	|          converge this parameter should be higher when first starting
	|          to learn, and decrease slowly over time.
	|
	|          Otherwise it can be kept somewhat high if the environment
	|          dynamics change progressively, and the algorithm will adapt
	|          accordingly. The final behavior of DoubleQLearning is very
	|          dependent on this parameter.
	|
	|          The learning rate parameter must be > 0.0 and <= 1.0,
	|          otherwise the function will throw an std::invalid_argument.
	|
	|          @param a The new learning rate parameter.
	|
	|  stepUpdateQ(...)
	|      stepUpdateQ( (DoubleQLearning)self, (int)s, (int)a, (int)s1, (float)rew) -> None :
	|          This function updates the internal QFunction using the discount set during construction.
	|
	|          This function takes a single experience point and uses it to
	|          update the QFunction. This is a very efficient method to
	|          keep the QFunction up to date with the latest experience.
	|
	|          @param s The previous state.
	|          @param a The action performed.
	|          @param s1 The new state.
	|          @param rew The reward obtained.

	class EpsilonPolicy(PolicyInterface)
	|  This class is a policy wrapper for epsilon action choice.
	|
	|  This class is used to wrap already existing policies to implement
	|  automatic exploratory behaviour (e.g. epsilon-greedy policies).
	|
	|  An epsilon-greedy policy is a policy that takes a greedy action a
	|  certain percentage of the time, and otherwise takes a random action.
	|  They are useful to force the agent to explore an unknown model, in order
	|  to gain new information to refine it and thus gain more reward.
	|
	|  Please note that to obtain an epsilon-greedy policy the wrapped
	|  policy needs to already be greedy with respect to the model.

	class ExpectedSARSA(Boost.Python.instance)
	|  This algorithm is a subtle improvement over the SARSA algorithm.
	|
	|  \sa SARSA
	|
	|  The difference between this algorithm and the original SARSA algorithm
	|  lies in the value used to approximate the value for the next timestep.
	|  In standard SARSA this value is directly taken as the current
	|  approximation of the value of the QFunction for the newly sampled state
	|  and the next action to be performed (the final 'SA' in SAR'SA').
	|
	|  In Expected SARSA this value is instead replaced by the expected value
	|  for the newly sampled state, given the policy from which we will sample
	|  the next action. In this sense Expected SARSA is more similar to
	|  QLearning: where QLearning uses the max over the QFunction for the next
	|  state, Expected SARSA uses the future expectation over the current
	|  online policy.
	|
	|  This reduces considerably the variance of the updates performed, which
	|  in turn allows to somewhat increase the learning rate for the method,
	|  which allows Expected SARSA to learn faster than simple SARSA. All
	|  guarantees of normal SARSA are maintained.

	|          a method (e.g. QGreedyPolicy).
	|
	|          At the same time ExpectedSARSA needs this policy in order to be

	|          timesteps. Thus the algorithm will optimize overall reward accretion. When less

	|
	|          The learning parameter determines the speed at which the

	|          deterministic environments (such as an agent moving through
	|          a grid, for example), this parameter can be safely set to
	|          1.0 for maximum learning.
	|
	|          On the other side, in stochastic environments, in order to
	|          converge this parameter should be higher when first starting
	|          to learn, and decrease slowly over time.
	|
	|          Otherwise it can be kept somewhat high if the environment
	|          dynamics change progressively, and the algorithm will adapt
	|          accordingly. The final behaviour of ExpectedSARSA is very
	|          dependent on this parameter.

	|
	|          This function takes a single experience point and uses it to
	|          update the QFunction. This is a very efficient method to
	|          keep the QFunction up to date with the latest experience.
	|
	|          Keep in mind that, since ExpectedSARSA needs to compute the
	|          QFunction for the currently used policy, it needs to know
	|          two consecutive state-action pairs, in order to correctly
	|          relate how the policy acts from state to state.
	|
	|          @param s The previous state.

	|  lower than alpha, is used when the change is negative.

	|  This is useful when using QLearning for multi-agent RL where each agent
	|  is independent. A multi-agent environment is non-stationary from the
	|  point of view of a single agent, which is disruptive for normal
	|  QLearning and generally prevents it to learn to coordinate with the
	|  other agents well.
	|
	|  By assigning a higher learning parameter to transitions resulting in a
	|  positive feedback, the agent insulates itself from bad results which
	|  happen when the other agents take exploratory actions.
	|
	|  Bad results are still guaranteed to be discovered, since the learning
	|  parameter is still greater than zero, but the algorithm tries to focus
	|  on the good things rather than the bad.
	|
	|  If the beta parameter is equal to the alpha, this becomes standard
	|  QLearning. When the beta parameter is zero, the algorithm becomes
	|  equivalent to Distributed QLearning.

	class MCTSGenerativeModelPython(Boost.Python.instance)
	|  This class represents the MCTS online planner using UCB1 for GenerativeModelPython.
	|
	|  NOTE: This algorithm is wrapped in Python, but as it uses the internal
	|  Models rather than a custom generative model to simulate rollouts it will
	|  probably be rather slow for interesting applications. You are of course
	|  welcome to try it out, but it is recommended that the generative model
	|  is written in C++.
	|
	|  This algorithm is an online planner for MDPs. As an online planner,
	|  it needs to have a generative model of the problem. This means that
	|  it only needs a way to sample transitions and rewards from the
	|  model, but it does not need to know directly the distribution
	|  probabilities for them.
	|
	|  MCTS plans for a single state at a time. It builds a tree structure
	|  progressively and action values are deduced as averages of the
	|  obtained rewards over rollouts. If the number of sample episodes is
	|  high enough, it is guaranteed to converge to the optimal solution.
	|
	|  At each rollout, we follow each action and resulting state within the
	|  tree from root to leaves. During this path we chose actions using an
	|  algorithm called UCT. What this does is privilege the most promising
	|  actions, while guaranteeing that in the limit every action will still
	|  be tried an infinite amount of times.
	|
	|  Once we arrive to a leaf in the tree, we then expand it with a
	|  single new node, representing a new state for the path we just
	|  followed. We then proceed outside the tree following a random
	|  policy, but this time we do not track which actions and states
	|  we actually experience. The final reward obtained by this random
	|  rollout policy is used to approximate the values for all nodes
	|  visited in this rollout inside the tree, before leaving it.
	|
	|  Since MCTS expands a tree, it can reuse work it has done if
	|  multiple action requests are done in order. To do so, it simply asks
	|  for the action that has been performed and its respective new state.
	|  Then it simply makes that root branch the new root, and starts
	|  again.

	|  This class represents the MCTS online planner using UCB1 for Model.
	|
	|  NOTE: This algorithm is wrapped in Python, but as it uses the internal
	|  Models rather than a custom generative model to simulate rollouts it will
	|  probably be rather slow for interesting applications. You are of course
	|  welcome to try it out, but it is recommended that the generative model
	|  is written in C++.
	|
	|  This algorithm is an online planner for MDPs. As an online planner,
	|  it needs to have a generative model of the problem. This means that
	|  it only needs a way to sample transitions and rewards from the
	|  model, but it does not need to know directly the distribution
	|  probabilities for them.
	|
	|  MCTS plans for a single state at a time. It builds a tree structure
	|  progressively and action values are deduced as averages of the
	|  obtained rewards over rollouts. If the number of sample episodes is
	|  high enough, it is guaranteed to converge to the optimal solution.
	|
	|  At each rollout, we follow each action and resulting state within the
	|  tree from root to leaves. During this path we chose actions using an
	|  algorithm called UCT. What this does is privilege the most promising
	|  actions, while guaranteeing that in the limit every action will still
	|  be tried an infinite amount of times.
	|
	|  Once we arrive to a leaf in the tree, we then expand it with a
	|  single new node, representing a new state for the path we just
	|  followed. We then proceed outside the tree following a random
	|  policy, but this time we do not track which actions and states
	|  we actually experience. The final reward obtained by this random
	|  rollout policy is used to approximate the values for all nodes
	|  visited in this rollout inside the tree, before leaving it.
	|
	|  Since MCTS expands a tree, it can reuse work it has done if
	|  multiple action requests are done in order. To do so, it simply asks
	|  for the action that has been performed and its respective new state.
	|  Then it simply makes that root branch the new root, and starts

	class MaximumLikelihoodModel(Boost.Python.instance)
	|  @brief This class models Experience as a Markov Decision Process using Maximum Likelihood.
	|
	|  Often an MDP is not known in advance. It is known that it can assume
	|  a certain set of states, and that a certain set of actions are
	|  available to the agent, but not much more. Thus, in these cases, the
	|  goal is not only to find out the best policy for the MDP we have,
	|  but at the same time learn the actual transition and reward
	|  functions of such a model. This task is called 'reinforcement
	|  learning'.
	|
	|  This class helps with this. A naive approach in reinforcement learning
	|  is to keep track, for each action, of its results, and deduce transition
	|  probabilities and rewards based on the data collected in such a way.
	|  This class does just this, using Maximum Likelihood Estimates to decide
	|  what the transition probabilities and rewards are.
	|
	|  This class maps an Experience object to the most likely transition
	|  reward functions that produced it. The transition function is guaranteed
	|  to be a correct probability function, as in the sum of the probabilities
	|  of all transitions from a particular state and a particular action is
	|  always 1. Each instance is not directly synced with the supplied
	|  Experience object. This is to avoid possible overheads, as the user can
	|  optimize better depending on their use case. See sync().
	|
	|  When little data is available, the deduced transition and reward
	|  functions may be significantly subject to noise. A possible way to
	|  improve on this is to artificially bias the data as to skew it towards
	|  certain distributions.  This could be done if some knowledge of the
	|  model (even approximate) is known, in order to speed up the learning
	|  process. Another way is to assume that all transitions are possible, add
	|  data to support that claim, and simply wait until the averages converge
	|  to the true values.  Another thing that can be done is to associate with
	|  each fake datapoint an high reward: this will skew the agent into trying
	|  out new actions, thinking it will obtained the high rewards. This is
	|  able to obtain automatically a good degree of exploration in the early
	|  stages of an episode. Such a technique is called 'optimistic
	|  initialization'.
	|
	|  Whether any of these techniques work or not can definitely depend on
	|  the model you are trying to approximate. Trying out things is good!

	|          be used to learn an MDP Model from the data, and initializes
	|          internal Model data.
	|
	|          The user can choose whether he wants to directly sync
	|          the MaximumLikelihoodModel to the underlying Experience, or delay

	class Model(Boost.Python.instance)
	|  This class represents a Markov Decision Process.
	|
	|  A Markov Decision Process (MDP) is a way to model decision making.
	|  The idea is that there is an agent situated in a stochastic
	|  environment which changes in discrete 'timesteps'. The agent can
	|  influence the way the environment changes via 'actions'. For each
	|  action the agent can perform, the environment will transition from a
	|  state 's' to a state 's1' following a certain transition function.
	|  The transition function specifies, for each triple SxAxS' the
	|  probability that such a transition will happen.
	|
	|  In addition, associated with transitions, the agent is able to
	|  obtain rewards. Thus, if it does good, the agent will obtain a
	|  higher reward than if it performed badly. The reward obtained by the
	|  agent is in addition associated with a 'discount' factor: at every
	|  step, the possible reward that the agent can collect is multiplied
	|  by this factor, which is a number between 0 and 1. The discount
	|  factor is used to model the fact that often it is preferable to
	|  obtain something sooner, rather than later.
	|
	|  Since all of this is governed by probabilities, it is possible to
	|  solve an MDP model in order to obtain an 'optimal policy', which is
	|  a way to select an action from a state which will maximize the
	|  expected reward that the agent is going to collect during its life.
	|  The expected reward is computed as the sum of every reward the agent
	|  collects at every timestep, keeping in mind that at every timestep
	|  the reward is further and further discounted.
	|
	|  Solving an MDP in such a way is called 'planning'. Planning
	|  solutions often include an 'horizon', which is the number of
	|  timesteps that are included in an episode. They can be finite or
	|  infinite. The optimal policy changes with respect to the horizon,
	|  since a higher horizon may offer access to reward-gaining
	|  opportunities farther in the future.
	|
	|  An MDP policy (be it the optimal one or another), is associated with
	|  two functions: a ValueFunction and a QFunction. The ValueFunction
	|  represents the expected return for the agent from any initial state,
	|  given that actions are going to be selected according to the policy.
	|  The QFunction is similar: it gives the expected return for a
	|  specific state-action pair, given that after the specified action
	|  one will act according to the policy.
	|
	|  Given that we are usually interested about the optimal policy, there
	|  are a couple of properties that are associated with the optimal
	|  policies functions.  First, the optimal policy can be derived from
	|  the optimal QFunction. The optimal policy simply selects, in a given
	|  state 's', the action that maximizes the value of the QFunction.  In
	|  the same way, the optimal ValueFunction can be computed from the
	|  optimal QFunction by selecting the max with respect to the action.
	|
	|  Since so much information can be extracted from the QFunction, lots
	|  of methods (mostly in Reinforcement Learning) try to learn it.

	|  This class is one of the many ways to represent an MDP Policy. In

	|
	|  The class offers facilities to sample from these distributions, so

	|
	|  Building this object is somewhat expensive, so it should be done

	class PolicyIteration(Boost.Python.instance)
	|  This class applies the policy iteration algorithm.
	|
	|  This algorithm begins with an arbitrary policy (random), and uses
	|  the PolicyEvaluation algorithm to find out the Values for each state
	|  of this policy.
	|
	|  Once this is done, the policy can be improved by using a greedy
	|  approach towards the QFunction found. The new policy is then newly
	|  evaluated, and the process repeated.
	|
	|  When the policy does not change anymore, it is guaranteed to be
	|  optimal, and the found QFunction is returned.

	class PrioritizedSweepingMaximumLikelihoodModel(Boost.Python.instance)
	|  This class represents the PrioritizedSweeping algorithm for MaximumLikelihoodModel.
	|
	|  This algorithm is a refinement of the DynaQ algorithm. Instead of
	|  randomly sampling experienced state action pairs to get more
	|  information, we order each pair based on an estimate of how much
	|  information we can still extract from them.
	|
	|  In particular, pairs are sorted based on the amount they modified
	|  the estimated ValueFunction on their last sample. This ensures that
	|  we always try to sample from useful pairs instead of randomly,
	|  extracting knowledge much faster.
	|
	|  At the same time, this algorithm keeps a threshold for each
	|  state-action pair, so that it does not have to internally store all
	|  the pairs and save some memory/cpu time keeping the queue updated.
	|  Only pairs which obtained an amount of change higher than this
	|  treshold are kept in the queue.
	|
	|  Differently from the QLearning and DynaQ algorithm, this class
	|  automatically computes the ValueFunction since it is useful to
	|  determine which state-action pairs are actually useful, so there's
	|  no need to compute it manually.
	|

	class QL(Boost.Python.instance)
	|  This class implements off-policy evaluation via Q(lambda).
	|  This algorithm is the off-policy equivalent of SARSAL. It scales traces
	|  using the lambda parameter, but is able to work in an off-line manner.
	|
	|  Unfortunately, as it does not take into account the discrepancy between
	|  behaviour and target policies, it tends to work only if the two policies
	|  are similar.
	|
	|  Note that even if the trace discount does not take into account the
	|  target policy, the error update is still computed using the target, and
	|  that is why the method works and does not just compute the value of the
	|  current behaviour policy.
	|
	|  This method behaves as an inefficient QLearning if you set the lambda
	|  parameter to zero (effectively cutting all traces), and the epsilon
	|  parameter to zero (forcing a perfectly greedy target policy).

	class QLearning(Boost.Python.instance)
	|  This class represents the QLearning algorithm.
	|
	|  This algorithm is a very simple but powerful way to learn the
	|  optimal QFunction for an MDP model, where the transition and reward
	|  functions are unknown. It works in an offline fashion, meaning that
	|  it can be used even if the policy that the agent is currently using
	|  is not the optimal one, or is different by the one currently
	|  specified by the QLearning QFunction.
	|
	|  The idea is to progressively update the QFunction averaging all
	|  obtained datapoints. This can be done by generating data via the
	|  model, or by simply sending the agent into the world to try stuff
	|  out. This allows to avoid modeling directly the transition and
	|  reward functions for unknown problems.
	|
	|  This algorithm is guaranteed convergence for stationary MDPs (MDPs
	|  that do not change their transition and reward functions over time),
	|  given that the learning parameter converges to 0 over time.
	|
	|  \sa setLearningRate(double)
	|
	|  At the same time, this algorithm can be used for non-stationary
	|  MDPs, and it will try to constantly keep up with changes in the
	|  environment, given that they are not huge.
	|
	|  This algorithm does not actually need to sample from the input
	|  model, and so it can be a good algorithm to apply in real world
	|  scenarios, where there would be no way to reproduce the world's
	|  behavior aside from actually trying out actions. However it is
	|  needed to know the size of the state space, the size of the action
	|  space and the discount factor of the problem.

	class QSoftmaxPolicy(QPolicyInterface)
	|  This class implements a softmax policy through a QFunction.
	|
	|  A softmax policy is a policy that selects actions based on their
	|  expected reward: the more advantageous an action seems to be, the more
	|  probable its selection is. There are many ways to implement a softmax
	|  policy, this class implements selection using the most common method of
	|  sampling from a Boltzmann distribution.
	|
	|  As the epsilon-policy, this type of policy is useful to force the agent
	|  to explore an unknown model, in order to gain new information to refine
	|  it and thus gain more reward.

	|          Following the Boltzmann distribution, as the temperature
	|          approaches infinity all actions will become equally

	|          approaches zero, action selection will become completely

	class RLearning(Boost.Python.instance)
	|  This class represents the QLearning algorithm.
	|
	|  This algorithm is a very simple but powerful way to learn the
	|  optimal QFunction for an MDP model, where the transition and reward
	|  functions are unknown. It works in an offline fashion, meaning that
	|  it can be used even if the policy that the agent is currently using
	|  is not the optimal one, or is different by the one currently
	|  specified by the QLearning QFunction.
	|
	|  The idea is to progressively update the QFunction averaging all
	|  obtained datapoints. This can be done by generating data via the
	|  model, or by simply sending the agent into the world to try stuff
	|  out. This allows to avoid modeling directly the transition and
	|  reward functions for unknown problems.
	|
	|  This algorithm is guaranteed convergence for stationary MDPs (MDPs
	|  that do not change their transition and reward functions over time),
	|  given that the learning parameter converges to 0 over time.
	|
	|  \sa setLearningRate(double)
	|
	|  At the same time, this algorithm can be used for non-stationary
	|  MDPs, and it will try to constantly keep up with changes in the
	|  environment, given that they are not huge.
	|
	|  This algorithm does not actually need to sample from the input
	|  model, and so it can be a good algorithm to apply in real world
	|  scenarios, where there would be no way to reproduce the world's
	|  behavior aside from actually trying out actions. However it is
	|  needed to know the size of the state space, the size of the action
	|  space and the discount factor of the problem.

	|  This class represents the SARSA algorithm.

	|  QFunction for an MDP model, where the transition and reward
	|  functions are unknown. It works in an online fashion, meaning that
	|  the QFunction learned is the one of the currently used policy.

	|  given that the learning parameter converges to 0 over time.
	|
	|  \sa setLearningRate(double)
	|
	|  The main difference between this algorithm and QLearning is that
	|  QLearning always tries to learn the optimal policy, regardless of
	|  the one that is currently being executed. Instead, SARSA tries to
	|  find a policy which can perform decently given exploration tradeoffs
	|  that must be done when learning the QFunction of a new environment.
	|  A possible use for this would be to run SARSA together with
	|  QLearning; during the training phase one would use SARSA actions in
	|  order to perform decently during the training. Afterwards, one could
	|  switch to the optimal policy learnt offline by QLearning.
	|
	|  This algorithm does not actually need to sample from the input

	|
	|          On the other side, in stochastic environments, in order to

	|
	|          Keep in mind that, since SARSA needs to compute the

	class SARSAL(Boost.Python.instance)
	|  This class represents the SARSAL algorithm.
	|
	|  This algorithms adds eligibility traces to the SARSA algorithm.
	|
	|  \sa SARSA
	|
	|  In order to more effectively use the data obtained, SARSAL keeps a list
	|  of previously visited state/action pairs, which are updated together
	|  with the last experienced transition. The updates all use the same
	|  value, with the difference that state/action pairs experienced more in
	|  the past are updated less (by discount*lambda per each previous
	|  timestep). Once this reducing coefficient falls below a certain
	|  threshold, the old state/action pair is forgotten and not updated
	|  anymore. If instead the pair is visited again, the coefficient is once
	|  again increased.
	|
	|  The idea is to be able to give credit to past actions for current reward
	|  in an efficient manner. This reduces the amount of data needed in order
	|  to backpropagate rewards, and allows SARSAL to learn faster.
	|
	|  This particular version of the algorithm implements capped traces: every
	|  time an action/state pair is witnessed, its eligibility trace is reset
	|  to 1.0. This avoids potentially diverging values which can happen with
	|  the normal eligibility traces.

	class AMDP(Boost.Python.instance)
	|  This class implements the Augmented MDP algorithm.
	|
	|  This algorithm transforms a POMDP into an approximately equivalent
	|  MDP. This is done by extending the original POMDP statespace with
	|  a discretized entropy component, which approximates a sufficient
	|  statistic for the belief. In essence, AMDP builds states which
	|  contain intrinsically information about the uncertainty of the agent.
	|
	|  In order to compute a new transition and reward function, AMDP needs
	|  to sample possible transitions at random, since each belief can
	|  potentially update to any other belief. We sample beliefs using
	|  the BeliefGenerator class which creates both random beliefs and
	|  beliefs generated using the original POMDP model, in order to try
	|  to obtain beliefs distributed in a way that better resembles the
	|  original problem.
	|
	|  Once this is done, it is simply a matter of taking each belief,
	|  computing every possible new belief given an action and observation,
	|  and sum up all possibilities.
	|
	|  This class also bundles together with the resulting MDP a function
	|  to convert an original POMDP belief into an equivalent AMDP state;
	|  this is done so that a policy can be applied, observation gathered
	|  and beliefs updated while continuing to use the approximated model.

	class GapMin(Boost.Python.instance)
	|  This class implements the GapMin algorithm.
	|
	|  This method works by repeatedly refining both a lower bound and upper
	|  bound for the input POMDP.
	|
	|  The lower bound is worked through PBVI.
	|
	|  The upper bound is worked through a combination of alphavectors, and a
	|  belief-value pair piecewise linear surface.
	|
	|  At each iteration, a set of beliefs are found that the algorithm thinks
	|  may be useful to reduce the bound.
	|
	|  For the lower bound, these beliefs are added to a list, and run through
	|  PBVI. Spurious beliefs are then removed.
	|
	|  For the upper bound, the beliefs are used to create a temporary belief
	|  POMDP, where each belief is a state. This belief is then used as input
	|  to the FastInformedBound algorithm, which refines its upper bound.
	|
	|  The strong point of the algorithm is that beliefs are searched by gap
	|  size, so that the beliefs that are most likely to decrease the gap are
	|  looked at first. This results in less overall work to highly reduce the
	|  bound.
	|
	|  In order to act, the output lower bound should be used (as it's the only
	|  one that gives an actual guarantee), but for this just using PBVI may be
	|  more useful.

	class IncrementalPruning(Boost.Python.instance)
	|  This class implements the Incremental Pruning algorithm.
	|
	|  This algorithm solves a POMDP Model perfectly. It computes solutions
	|  for each horizon incrementally, every new solution building upon the
	|  previous one.
	|
	|  From each solution, it computes the full set of possible
	|  projections. It then computes all possible cross-sums of such
	|  projections, in order to compute all possible vectors that can be
	|  included in the final solution.
	|
	|  What makes this method unique is its pruning strategy. Instead of
	|  generating every possible vector, combining them and pruning, it
	|  tries to prune at every possible occasion in order to minimize the
	|  number of possible vectors at any given time. Thus it will prune
	|  after creating the projections, after every single cross-sum, and
	|  in the end when combining all projections for each action.
	|
	|  The performances of this method are *heavily* dependent on the linear
	|  programming methods used. In particular, this code currently
	|  utilizes the lp_solve55 library. However, this library is not the
	|  most efficient implementation, as it defaults to a somewhat slow
	|  solver, and its problem-building API also tends to be slow due to
	|  lots of bounds checking (which are cool, but sometimes people know
	|  what they are doing). Still, to avoid replicating infinite amounts
	|  of code and managing memory by ourselves, we use its API. It would
	|  be nice if one day we could port directly into the code a fast lp
	|  implementation; for now we do what we can.

	class LinearSupport(Boost.Python.instance)
	|  This class represents the LinearSupport algorithm.
	|
	|  This method is similar in spirit to Witness. The idea is that we look at
	|  certain belief points, and we try to find the best alphavectors in those
	|  points. Rather than looking for them though, the idea here is that we
	|  *know* where they are, if there are any at all.
	|
	|  As the ValueFunction is piecewise linear and convex, if there's any
	|  other hyperplane that we can add to improve it, the improvements are
	|  going to be maximal at one of the vertices of the original surface.
	|
	|  The idea thus is the following: first we compute the set of alphavectors
	|  for the corners, so we can be sure about them. Then we find all vertices
	|  that those alphavectors create, and we compute the error between the
	|  true ValueFunction and their current values.
	|
	|  If the error is greater than a certain amount, we allow their supporting
	|  alphavector to join the ValueFunction, and we increase the size of the
	|  vertex set by adding all new vertices that are created by adding the new
	|  surface (and removing the ones that are made useless by it).
	|
	|  We repeat until we have checked all available vertices, and at that
	|  point we are done.
	|
	|  While this can be a very inefficient algorithm, the fact that vertices
	|  are checked in an orderly fashion, from highest error to lowest, allows
	|  if one needs it to convert this algorithm into an anytime algorithm.
	|  Even if there is limited time to compute the solution, the algorithm is
	|  guaranteed to work in the areas with high error first, allowing one to
	|  compute good approximations even without a lot of resources.

	class Model(AIToolbox.MDP.Model)
	|  This class represents a Partially Observable Markov Decision Process.
	|
	|  This class inherits from any valid MDP model type, so that it can
	|  use its base methods, and it builds from those. Templated inheritance
	|  was chosen to improve performance and keep code small, instead of
	|  doing composition.
	|
	|  A POMDP is an MDP where the agent, at each timestep, does not know
	|  in which state it is. Instead, after each action is performed, it
	|  obtains an 'observation', which offers some information as to which
	|  new state the agent has transitioned to. This observation is
	|  determined by an 'observation function', that maps S'xAxO to a
	|  probability: the probability of obtaining observation O after taking
	|  action A and *landing* in state S'.
	|
	|  Since now its knowledge is imperfect, in order to represent the
	|  knowledge of the state it is currently in, the agent is thus forced
	|  to use Beliefs: probability distributions over states.
	|
	|  The way a Belief works is that, after each action and observation,
	|  the agent can reason as follows: given my previous Belief
	|  (distribution over states) that I think I was in, what is now the
	|  probability that I transitioned to any particular state? This new
	|  Belief can be computed from the Model, given that the agent knows
	|  the distributions of the transition and observation functions.
	|
	|  Turns out that a POMDP can be viewed as an MDP with an infinite
	|  number of states, where each state is essentially a Belief. Since a
	|  Belief is a vector of real numbers, there are infinite of them, thus
	|  the infinite number of states. While POMDPs can be much more
	|  powerful than MDPs for modeling real world problems, where
	|  information is usually not perfect, it turns out that this
	|  infinite-state property makes them so much harder to solve
	|  perfectly, and their solutions much more complex.
	|
	|  A POMDP solution is composed by several policies, which apply in
	|  different ranges of the Belief space, and suggest different actions
	|  depending on the observations received by the agent at each
	|  timestep. The values of those policies can be, in the same way,
	|  represented as a number of value vectors (called alpha vectors in
	|  the literature) that apply in those same ranges of the Belief space.
	|  Each alpha vector is somewhat similar to an MDP ValueFunction.

	class PBVI(Boost.Python.instance)
	|  This class implements the Point Based Value Iteration algorithm.
	|
	|  The idea behind this algorithm is to solve a POMDP Model
	|  approximately. When computing a perfect solution, the main problem
	|  is pruning the resulting ValueFunction in order to contain only a
	|  parsimonious representation. What this means is that many vectors
	|  inside can be dominated by others, and so they do not add any
	|  additional information, while at the same time occupying memory and
	|  computational time.
	|
	|  The way this method tries to fix the problem is by solving the Model
	|  in a set of specified Beliefs. Doing so results in no need for
	|  pruning at all, since every belief uniquely identifies one of the
	|  optimal solution vectors (only uniqueness in the final set is
	|  required, but it is way cheaper than linear programming).
	|
	|  The set of Beliefs are stochastically computed as to cover as much
	|  as possible of the belief space, to ensure minimization of the final
	|  error. The final solution will thus be correct 100% in the Beliefs
	|  that have been selected, and will (possibly) overshoot in
	|  non-covered Beliefs.
	|
	|  In addition, the fact that we solve only for a fixed set of Beliefs
	|  guarantees that our final solution is limited in size, which is
	|  useful since even small POMDP true solutions can explode in size
	|  with high horizons, for very little gain.
	|
	|  There is no convergence guarantee of this method, but the error is
	|  bounded.

	class PERSEUS(Boost.Python.instance)
	|  This class implements the PERSEUS algorithm.
	|
	|  The idea behind this algorithm is very similar to PBVI. The thing
	|  that changes is how beliefs are considered; in PERSEUS we only try
	|  to find as little VEntries as possible as to ensure that all beliefs
	|  considered are improved. This allows to skip generating VEntry for
	|  most beliefs considered, since usually few VEntry are responsible
	|  for supporting most of the beliefs.
	|
	|  At the same time, this means that solutions found by PERSEUS may be
	|  *extremely* approximate with respect to the true Value Functions. This
	|  is because as long as the values for all the particle beliefs are
	|  increased, no matter how slightly, the algorithm stops looking - in
	|  effect simply guaranteeing that the worst action is never taken.
	|  However for many problems the solution found is actually very good,
	|  also given that due to the increased performance PERSEUS can do
	|  many more iterations than, for example, PBVI.
	|
	|  This method is works best when it is allowed to iterate until convergence,

	class POMCPModel(Boost.Python.instance)
	|  This class represents the POMCP online planner using UCB1 for Model.
	|
	|  NOTE: This algorithm is wrapped in Python, but as it uses the internal
	|  Models rather than a custom generative model to simulate rollouts it will
	|  probably be rather slow for interesting applications. You are of course
	|  welcome to try it out, but it is recommended that the generative model
	|  is written in C++.
	|
	|  This algorithm is an online planner for POMDPs. As an online planner,
	|  it needs to have a generative model of the problem. This means that
	|  it only needs a way to sample transitions and rewards from the
	|  model, but it does not need to know directly the distribution
	|  probabilities for them.
	|
	|  POMCP plans for a single belief at a time. It follows the logic of
	|  Monte Carlo Tree Sampling, where a tree structure is build
	|  progressively and action values are deduced as averages of the
	|  obtained rewards over rollouts. If the number of sample episodes is
	|  high enough, it is guaranteed to converge to the optimal solution.
	|
	|  At each rollout, we follow each action and observation within the
	|  tree from root to leaves. During this path we chose actions using an
	|  algorithm called UCT. What this does is privilege the most promising
	|  actions, while guaranteeing that in the limit every action will still
	|  be tried an infinite amount of times.
	|
	|  Once we arrive to a leaf in the tree, we then expand it with a
	|  single new node, representing a new observation we just collected.
	|  We then proceed outside the tree following a random policy, but this
	|  time we do not track which actions and observations we actually
	|  take/obtain. The final reward obtained by this random rollout policy
	|  is used to approximate the values for all nodes visited in this
	|  rollout inside the tree, before leaving it.
	|
	|  Since POMCP expands a tree, it can reuse work it has done if
	|  multiple action requests are done in order. To do so, it simply asks
	|  for the action that has been performed and its respective obtained
	|  observation. Then it simply makes that root branch the new root, and
	|  starts again.
	|
	|  In order to avoid performing belief updates between each
	|  action/observation pair, which can be expensive, POMCP uses particle
	|  beliefs. These approximate the beliefs at every step, and are used
	|  to select states in the rollouts.
	|
	|  A weakness of this implementation is that, as every particle
	|  approximation of continuous values, it will lose particles in time.
	|  To fight this a possibility is to implement a particle
	|  reinvigoration method, which would introduce noise in the particle
	|  beliefs in order to keep them 'fresh' (possibly using domain
	|  knowledge).

	class POMCPSparseModel(Boost.Python.instance)
	|  This class represents the POMCP online planner using UCB1 for SparseModel.
	|
	|  NOTE: This algorithm is wrapped in Python, but as it uses the internal
	|  Models rather than a custom generative model to simulate rollouts it will
	|  probably be rather slow for interesting applications. You are of course
	|  welcome to try it out, but it is recommended that the generative model
	|  is written in C++.
	|
	|  This algorithm is an online planner for POMDPs. As an online planner,
	|  it needs to have a generative model of the problem. This means that
	|  it only needs a way to sample transitions and rewards from the
	|  model, but it does not need to know directly the distribution
	|  probabilities for them.
	|
	|  POMCP plans for a single belief at a time. It follows the logic of
	|  Monte Carlo Tree Sampling, where a tree structure is build
	|  progressively and action values are deduced as averages of the
	|  obtained rewards over rollouts. If the number of sample episodes is
	|  high enough, it is guaranteed to converge to the optimal solution.
	|
	|  At each rollout, we follow each action and observation within the
	|  tree from root to leaves. During this path we chose actions using an
	|  algorithm called UCT. What this does is privilege the most promising
	|  actions, while guaranteeing that in the limit every action will still
	|  be tried an infinite amount of times.
	|
	|  Once we arrive to a leaf in the tree, we then expand it with a
	|  single new node, representing a new observation we just collected.
	|  We then proceed outside the tree following a random policy, but this
	|  time we do not track which actions and observations we actually
	|  take/obtain. The final reward obtained by this random rollout policy
	|  is used to approximate the values for all nodes visited in this
	|  rollout inside the tree, before leaving it.
	|
	|  Since POMCP expands a tree, it can reuse work it has done if
	|  multiple action requests are done in order. To do so, it simply asks
	|  for the action that has been performed and its respective obtained
	|  observation. Then it simply makes that root branch the new root, and
	|  starts again.
	|
	|  In order to avoid performing belief updates between each
	|  action/observation pair, which can be expensive, POMCP uses particle
	|  beliefs. These approximate the beliefs at every step, and are used
	|  to select states in the rollouts.
	|
	|  A weakness of this implementation is that, as every particle
	|  approximation of continuous values, it will lose particles in time.
	|  To fight this a possibility is to implement a particle
	|  reinvigoration method, which would introduce noise in the particle
	|  beliefs in order to keep them 'fresh' (possibly using domain
	|  knowledge).

	class Policy(PolicyInterface)
	|  This class represents a POMDP Policy.
	|
	|  This class currently represents a basic Policy adaptor for a
	|  POMDP::ValueFunction. What this class does is to extract the policy
	|  tree contained within a POMDP::ValueFunction. The idea is that, at
	|  each horizon, the ValueFunction contains a set of applicable
	|  solutions (alpha vectors) for the POMDP. At each Belief point, only
	|  one of those vectors applies.
	|
	|  This class finds out at every belief which is the vector that
	|  applies, and returns the appropriate action. At the same time, it
	|  provides facilities to follow the chosen vector along the tree
	|  (since future actions depend on the observations obtained by the
	|  agent).

	|  getH(...)
	|      getH( (Policy)self) -> int :
	|          This function returns the highest horizon available within this Policy.
	|
	|          Note that all functions that accept an horizon as a
	|          parameter DO NOT check the bounds of that variable. In
	|          addition, note that while for S,A,O getters you get a number
	|          that exceeds by 1 the values allowed (since counting starts
	|          from 0), here the bound is actually included in the limit,
	|          as horizon 0 does not really do anything.
	|
	|          Example: getH() returns 5. This means that 5 is the highest
	|          allowed parameter for an horizon in any other Policy method.
	|
	|          @return The highest horizon policied.
	|

	|
	|  sampleAction(...)
	|      sampleAction( (Policy)self, (Vector)b, (int)horizon) -> object :
	|          This function chooses a random action for belief b when horizon steps are missing, following the policy distribution.
	|
	|          There are a couple of differences between this sampling
	|          function and the simpler version. The first one is that this
	|          function is actually able to sample from different
	|          timesteps, since this class is able to maintain a full
	|          policy tree over time.
	|
	|          The second difference is that it returns two values. The
	|          first one is the requested action.  The second return value
	|          is an id that allows the policy to compute more efficiently
	|          the sampled action during the next timestep, if provided to
	|          the Policy together with the obtained observation.
	|
	|          @param b The sampled belief of the policy.
	|          @param horizon The requested horizon, meaning the number of
	|                         timesteps missing until the end of the
	|                         'episode'. horizon 0 will return a valid,
	|                         non-specified action.
	|
	|          @return A tuple containing the chosen action, plus an id
	|                  useful to sample an action more efficiently at the
	|                  next timestep, if required.
	|
	|      sampleAction( (Policy)self, (int)id, (int)o, (int)horizon) -> object :
	|          This function chooses a random action after performing a sampled action and observing observation o, for a particular horizon.
	|
	|          This sampling function is provided in case an already
	|          sampled action has been performed, an observation
	|          registered, and now a new action is needed for the next
	|          timestep. Using this function is highly recommended, as no
	|          belief update is necessary, and no lookup in a possibly very
	|          long list of VEntries required.
	|
	|          Note that this function works if and only if the horizon is
	|          going to be 1 (one) less than the value used for the
	|          previous sampling, otherwise anything could happen.
	|
	|          To keep things simple, the id does not store internally the
	|          needed horizon value, and you are requested to keep track of
	|          it yourself.
	|
	|          An example of usage for this function would be:
	|
	|          ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~{.cpp}
	|          horizon = 3;
	|          // First sample
	|          auto result = sampleAction(belief, horizon);
	|          // We do the action, something happens, we get an observation.
	|          size_t observation = performAction(std::get<0>(result));
	|          --horizon;
	|          // We sample again, after reducing the horizon, with the previous id.
	|          result = sampleAction(std::get<1>(result), observation, horizon);
	|          ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
	|
	|          @param id An id returned from a previous call of sampleAction.
	|          @param o The observation obtained after performing a previously
	|                   sampled action.
	|          @param horizon The new horizon, equal to the old sampled horizon-1.
	|

	class QMDP(Boost.Python.instance)
	|  This class implements the QMDP algorithm.
	|
	|  QMDP is a particular way to approach a POMDP problem and solve it
	|  approximately. The idea is to compute a solution that disregards the
	|  partial observability for all timesteps but the next one. Thus, we
	|  assume that after the next action the agent will suddenly be able to
	|  see the true state of the environment, and act accordingly. In doing
	|  so then, it will use an MDP value function.
	|
	|  Remember that only the solution process acts this way. When time to
	|  act the QMDP solution is simply applied at every timestep, every
	|  time assuming that the partial observability is going to last one
	|  step.
	|
	|  All in all, this class is pretty much a converter of an
	|  MDP::ValueFunction into a POMDP::ValueFunction.
	|
	|  Although the solution is approximate and overconfident (since we
	|  assume that partial observability is going to go away, we think we
	|  are going to get more reward), it is still good to obtain a closer
	|  upper bound on the true solution. This can be used, for example, to
	|  boost bounds on online methods, decreasing the time they take to
	|  converge.
	|
	|  The solution returned by QMDP will thus have only horizon 1, since
	|  the horizon requested is implicitly encoded in the MDP part of the
	|  solution.

	class SparseModel(AIToolbox.MDP.SparseModel)
	|  This class represents a Partially Observable Markov Decision Process.
	|
	|  This class inherits from any valid MDP model type, so that it can
	|  use its base methods, and it builds from those. Templated inheritance
	|  was chosen to improve performance and keep code small, instead of
	|  doing composition.
	|
	|  A POMDP is an MDP where the agent, at each timestep, does not know
	|  in which state it is. Instead, after each action is performed, it
	|  obtains an 'observation', which offers some information as to which
	|  new state the agent has transitioned to. This observation is
	|  determined by an 'observation function', that maps S'xAxO to a
	|  probability: the probability of obtaining observation O after taking
	|  action A and *landing* in state S'.
	|
	|  Since now its knowledge is imperfect, in order to represent the
	|  knowledge of the state it is currently in, the agent is thus forced
	|  to use Beliefs: probability distributions over states.
	|
	|  The way a Belief works is that, after each action and observation,
	|  the agent can reason as follows: given my previous Belief
	|  (distribution over states) that I think I was in, what is now the
	|  probability that I transitioned to any particular state? This new
	|  Belief can be computed from the Model, given that the agent knows
	|  the distributions of the transition and observation functions.
	|
	|  Turns out that a POMDP can be viewed as an MDP with an infinite
	|  number of states, where each state is essentially a Belief. Since a
	|  Belief is a vector of real numbers, there are infinite of them, thus
	|  the infinite number of states. While POMDPs can be much more
	|  powerful than MDPs for modeling real world problems, where
	|  information is usually not perfect, it turns out that this
	|  infinite-state property makes them so much harder to solve
	|  perfectly, and their solutions much more complex.
	|
	|  A POMDP solution is composed by several policies, which apply in
	|  different ranges of the Belief space, and suggest different actions
	|  depending on the observations received by the agent at each
	|  timestep. The values of those policies can be, in the same way,
	|  represented as a number of value vectors (called alpha vectors in
	|  the literature) that apply in those same ranges of the Belief space.
	|  Each alpha vector is somewhat similar to an MDP ValueFunction.
	|
	|  The difference between this class and the POMDP::Model class is that
	|  this class stores observations in a sparce matrix. This results in a
	|  possibly slower access to individual probabilities, but immeasurably
	|  speeds up computation with some classes of planning algorithms in
	|  case the number of possible observations is very small with respect
	|  to the total theoretic observation space of SxAxO. It also of course
	|  incredibly reduces memory consumption in such cases, which may also
	|  improve speed by effect of improved caching.

	class Witness(Boost.Python.instance)
	|  This class implements the Witness algorithm.
	|
	|  This algorithm solves a POMDP Model perfectly. It computes solutions
	|  for each horizon incrementally, every new solution building upon the
	|  previous one.
	|
	|  The Witness algorithm tries to avoid creating all possible cross-sums
	|  of the projected vectors. Instead, it relies on a proof that states
	|  that if a VEntry is suboptimal, then we can at least find a better one
	|  by modifying a single subtree.
	|
	|  Given this, the Witness algorithm starts off by finding a single optimal
	|  VEntry for a random belief. Then, using the theorem, it knows that if a
	|  better VEntry exists, then there must be at least one VEntry completely
	|  equal to the one we just found but for a subtree, and that one will
	|  be better. Thus, it adds to an agenda all possible variations of the
	|  found optimal VEntry.
	|
	|  From there, it examines each one of them, trying to look for a witness
	|  point. Once found, again it produces an optimal VEntry for that point
	|  and adds to the agenda all of its possible variations. VEntry which do
	|  not have any witness points are removed from the agenda.
	|
	|  In addition, Witness will not add to the agenda any VEntry which it has
	|  already added; it uses a set to keep track of which combinations of
	|  subtrees it has already tried.

	FUNCTIONS
	computeOptimisticValue(...)
	computeOptimisticValue( (Vector)p, (vec_eigen_v)points, (object)values) -> float :
	This function computes the optimistic value of a point given known vertices and values.
	
	This function computes an LP to determine the best possible value of a
	point given all known best vertices around it.
	
	This function is needed in multi-objective settings (rather than
	POMDPs), since the step where we compute the optimal value for a given
	point is extremely expensive (it requires solving a full MDP). Thus
	linear programming is used in order to determine an optimistic bound
	when deciding the next point to extract from the queue during the linear
	support process.
	
	Note that the input is the same as a PointSurface; the two components
	have been kept as separate arguments simply to allow more freedom to the
	user.
	
	@param p The point where we want to compute the best possible value.
	@param points The points that make up the surface.
	@param values The respective values of the input points.
	
	@return The best possible value that the input point can have given the known vertices.
	
	findVerticesNaive(...)
	findVerticesNaive( (vec_eigen_v)tests, (vec_eigen_v)planes) -> object :
	This function implements a naive vertex enumeration algorithm.
	
	This function goes through every subset of planes of size S, and finds
	all vertices it can. In particular, it goes through the first list one
	element at a time, and joins it with S-1 elements from the second list.
	
	Even more precisely, we take >= 1 elements from the second list. The
	remaining elements (so that in total we still use S-1) are simply the
	simplex boundaries, which allows us to find the corners located there.
	
	This method may find duplicate vertices (it does not bother to prune
	them), as a vertex can be in the convergence of more than S planes.
	
	The advantage is that we do not need any linear programming, and simple
	matrix decomposition techniques suffice.
	
	Warning: the values of each vertex depends on the planes it has been
	found of, and thus may *not* be the true value if considering all planes
	at the same time!
	
	@param tests The range of the planes to find vertices for.
	@param planes The range of all other planes.
	
	@return A non-unique list of all the vertices found.
	
	updateBelief(...)
	updateBelief( (Model)model, (Vector)b, (int)a, (int)o) -> Vector :
	This function creates a new Belief by updating the input Belie
	with the input action and observation, following th
	transition/observation functions contained in the input model
	
	@param model The model used to update the belief
	@param b The old belief
	@param a The action taken during the transition
	@param o The observation registered
	
	updateBelief( (SparseModel)model, (Vector)b, (int)a, (int)o) -> Vector :
	This function creates a new Belief by updating the input Belie
	with the input action and observation, following th

	@param model The model used to update the belief
	@param b The old belief
	@param a The action taken during the transition
