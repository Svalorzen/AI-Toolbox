Contribution Guidelines
=======================

Hi! Thanks for taking the time and interest to try to help make AI-Toolbox a
better project! You can do many things to help:

- Signal any interesting papers or algorithms that you think would be a good fit
  for the project, and open issues so that they can get into the implementation
  pipeline (add them to issue #7 on GitHub).
- Write more tests, examples, documentation, or in general report missing
  information or mistakes you find in the project so that they can be fixed.
- Implement more algorithms yourself.

About the last point, I'd very much prefer if you discuss any new implementation
with me before working away at a patch. I maintain this library for many
reasons, one of which is the opportunity to learn and improve by reading new
papers and try to implement them. For this reason, I'd love to have a first
opportunity myself to write new core code. Please open a new issue about these.

If it is something I don't really care about, then you can implement it
yourself! Otherwise I'll really try my best to get a working implementation up
and running as soon as I possibly can.

How to Contribute
-----------------

Just create a new branch, do your improvements and open a pull request! All
contributions should aim to be at least at the level of documentation and
quality of the project in its current state.

All code contribution should try to be consistent with the code style of
existing code. There is no official style guide (although the Google one is
close to what I usually do), so just try to get close and worst case I'll just
point out some minor things to change.

Signing Commits
---------------

In order to avoid copyright problems, all commits in your pull requests should
be signed by you. To sign a commit it is sufficient to call `git commit` with
the `-s`, which will add a signed off line to the commit message (this message
can also be included by hand if need be). The signoff certifies that you have
read and accepted the following:

This Developer Certificate of Origin (DCO) is also used by the Linux kernel in
order to attest that you have the rights to submit the code in your patches.
The code still remains yours (or of whoever it was originally). This is pretty
much all the extra that is needed.
