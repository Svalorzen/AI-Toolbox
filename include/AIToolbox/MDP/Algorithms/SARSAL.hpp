     * @brief This class represents the SARSAL algorithm.
     *
     * This algorithms adds eligibility traces to the SARSA algorithm.
     *
     * \sa SARSA
     *
     * In order to more effectively use the data obtained, SARSAL keeps a list
     * of previously visited state/action pairs, which are updated together
     * with the last experienced transition. The updates all use the same
     * value, with the difference that state/action pairs experienced more in
     * the past are updated less (by discount*lambda per each previous
     * timestep). Once this reducing coefficient falls below a certain
     * threshold, the old state/action pair is forgotten and not updated
     * anymore. If instead the pair is visited again, the coefficient is once
     * again increased.
     *
     * The idea is to be able to give credit to past actions for current reward
     * in an efficient manner. This reduces the amount of data needed in order
     * to backpropagate rewards, and allows SARSAL to learn faster.
     *
     * This particular version of the algorithm implements capped traces: every
     * time an action/state pair is witnessed, its eligibility trace is reset
     * to 1.0. This avoids potentially diverging values which can happen with
     * the normal eligibility traces.
